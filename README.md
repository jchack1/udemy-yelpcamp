# udemy-yelpcamp

Built Yelpcamp as a code-along project for my Web Developer Bootcamp Udemy course. Much of the functionality is the same as what was shown in the course, with a few styling adjustments.

Created with Node.js, Express, MongoDB on the backend, EJS for templating, and Bootstrap for styling.

This site is a CRUD application which allows the user to add, edit, and delete campgrounds and comments. Passport JS enables users to register, login, and logout. A user must be authenticated before they can comment on a campground, create a campground, or delete/edit their own campgrounds and comments.
